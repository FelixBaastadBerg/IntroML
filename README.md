# Decision Tree Coursework â€“ COMP70050 (Introduction to Machine Learning)

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** for indoor room localisation using WiFi signal strengths.  
The work follows the COMP70050 coursework specification and includes both training and pruning functionality, along with visualization support.

## ðŸ§  Overview

The project builds and evaluates decision trees on both **clean** and **noisy** datasets (`wifi_db/clean_dataset.txt`, `wifi_db/noisy_dataset.txt`), using **10-fold cross-validation**.  
It supports post-training **reduced-error pruning** and includes optional tree visualization for the clean dataset.

**Main file:** `main.py`  
**Core functionality:**  
- Decision tree learning with continuous features  
- 10-fold cross-validation  
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score per class  
- Reduced-error pruning  
- Depth measurement  
- Tree visualization
